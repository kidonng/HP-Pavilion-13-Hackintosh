# üçé HP Pavilion 13 Hackintosh

**PLEASE READ THE [NOTES](#notes) FIRST**

This project tries to provide an open and working macOS setup for **HP Pavilion 13** laptop based on [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg), while achieving the following goals:

- Support as many features as we can
- Align with [`Sample.plist`](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Sample.plist) as much as possible
- Use as little [`Quirks`](https://dortania.github.io/docs/release/Configuration.html#:~:text=Quirks%20provides%20support%20for%20specific%20workarounds.) as feasible

Note that this laptop comes in many variants, this EFI is created on the specs shown below, your miles may vary.
