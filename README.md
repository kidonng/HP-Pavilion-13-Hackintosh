## Notes

- **Set `AppleXcpmCfgLock` to `true` if CFG lock is not unlocked**.

  Note that certain actions such as performing security reset in BIOS will reset CFG lock.

- **Use different `PlatformInfo` values (`Serial`, `ROM`, etc.)**
- If macOS installation stuck on messages beginning with `AirportI`, try force rebooting.
